# Data Analysis in Google Colab

## Project Description
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis using a synthetic weather dataset, with the goal of predicting the weather type (Rainy, Sunny, Cloudy, Snowy) based on meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, UV index, season, and visibility.

### Notebook Structure
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Various dataset variables are explored, including the distribution of different weather types and their distinctive characteristics. The relationship between variables such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation with the weather type is analyzed.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs are presented to illustrate the relationship between meteorological variables and weather types. Scatter plots, bar charts, and box plots are used to show the distribution and relationships of the variables.
- **Conclusions**: Key insights about weather prediction are drawn, and the relevance of each analyzed feature is highlighted. Variables like temperature, precipitation, and UV index play significant roles in classifying weather types.

## Key Findings
- Temperature and precipitation are significant variables in predicting the weather type, with clear patterns that differentiate sunny and rainy weather.
- The UV index shows a correlation with sunny days, while humidity tends to be higher in rainy and cloudy climates.
- Visibility and atmospheric pressure also influence the variety of weather types, providing additional information to improve predictions.
